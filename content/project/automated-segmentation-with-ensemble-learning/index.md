1. Train six different deep learning auto-segmentation models based on 3D U-Net and Residual 3D U-Net architectures.
2. Implement an average ensemble and an optimal weighted average ensemble to improve prediction performance.
3. Augmented the streamline and accuracy of treatment planning for sarcoma tumor and its surrounding muscles.
